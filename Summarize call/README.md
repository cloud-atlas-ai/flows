# Summarize call

The summarize call flow summarizes a call. It's meant to be executed from a note with the full transcript of a call.

## Suggested usage

For this flow to work well:

- Customize the User Prompt to include your name to help Cloud Atlas identify you among the call participants.
- Include the transcript. There are loads of tools that can help you with this, for example you might want to try:
  - [Krisp.AI](https://krisp.ai/) can take transcripts alongside removing background noise.
  - [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/).
  - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) can generate transcripts.
- Include any notes you took during the call.
- Turn references to people, companies, projects into wikilinks. This will get them to be sent along to Cloud Atlas as additional context.
