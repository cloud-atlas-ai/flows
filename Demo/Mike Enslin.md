Mike Enslin is the protagonist of Stephen King's short story "1408," which is included in the collection titled "Everything's Eventual." Within the context of the story, Enslin is an author who specializes in investigating and writing about allegedly haunted places. He is known for his series of non-fiction books with titles like "Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards" and "Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses" which suggest he has made quite a career out of these explorations, despite being somewhat cynical of the supernatural.

In terms of his life story, there isn't an extensive background provided for Enslin within the short story, but from the details presented, we can extrapolate certain aspects. Enslin is likely a skeptic at heart, fueled by his interest in debunking myths of the paranormal rather than confirming them. This skepticism serves as both a strength and a driving force behind his career. His works imply a systematic and rigorous approach to his explorations, which would require discipline and an analytical mindâ€”traits that contribute to his success as an author.

Enslin's strengths are also evident in his willingness to confront fear and the unknown. By consistently placing himself in places deemed terrifying by others, Enslin demonstrates courage and a strong will. He's resourceful, adapting to various situations he encounters within these haunted locations, and he has a knack for descriptive writing that captivates his readers.

When it comes to his priorities in life, it seems that Enslin values truth and reality over superstition, wanting to either validate or debunk the existence of the paranormal with actual experiences. This dedication to his craft suggests a commitment to both his readers and himself to pursue the truth, no matter how frightening or dangerous his investigations may become.

Drawing from all this, the essence of Mike Enslin's character speaks to the human experience of facing the unknown and the lengths one might go to find answers to life's most profound mysteries. His strength lies in his quest for truth, but it's also his vulnerability, as his experiences in Room 1408 reveal the fragile grip we all have on what we perceive as reality.
