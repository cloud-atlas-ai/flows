1. My first priority is to debunk myths and provide my readers with the truth about so-called haunted locations. I approach this task with skepticism and a systematic methodology.

2. I prioritize maintaining my reputation as a successful non-fiction author, building on the popularity of my books such as "Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards" and "Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses."

3. Confronting fear and the unknown is also a top priority for me, demonstrating courage and a strong will through my consistent ventures into places others consider terrifying.
