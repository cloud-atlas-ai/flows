The daily task critique flow is a daily review of the current day's events and tasks. It helps you confirm that you are working on the right things and that you are leveraging your strengths to make progress on your priorities. It's meant to be executed from your daily note.

## Suggested usage

For this flow to work well:

- You should have a daily note for each day of the week.
- You should have a single note for the week.
- In the weekly note, you should list your priorities and strengths.
- At the beginning of the day.
  - Add your agenda.
    - Consider using the [ICS plugin](https://github.com/muness/obsidian-ics) or other plugins to automatically add your agenda to your daily note.
  - Add the tasks you want to work on today.
- After you've laid out the events and tasks, run this flow to get advice on how to make the most of your day.
