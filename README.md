# Cloud Atlas Flows

A flow in Cloud Atlas is a powerful tool that simplifies and elevates your note-taking experience.

This repository includes multiple curated flows that you can use to get started with Cloud Atlas. Each flow is a collection of notes that are linked together to help you achieve a specific goal. You can use these flows as a starting point to build your own flows, or you can use them as-is.

## How to use a flow

1. Download the flow (the `<flow>.flow.md` file) you want to use from this repository.
2. Add it to your `<vault>/CloudAtlas/` folder.
3. Reload the vault.

Flows are intended to run in the context of a note in your vault. The note, linked notes and backlinked notes will be used as context for Cloud Atlas.
