# Cloud Atlas Flows

A flow in Cloud Atlas is a powerful tool that simplifies and elevates your note-taking experience.

This repository includes multiple curated flows that you can use to get started with Cloud Atlas. Each flow is a collection of notes that are linked together to help you achieve a specific goal. You can use these flows as a starting point to build your own flows, or you can use them as-is.

## How to use a flow

1. Download the flow you want to use from this repository.
2. Add it to your <vault>/CloudAtlas/ folder.
3. Reload the vault.

Note that flows are intended to run in the context of a note in your vault. The note and linked notes will be used as context for the flow when it runs to supply Cloud Atlas with the information it needs to perform the actions specified in the User Prompt.
