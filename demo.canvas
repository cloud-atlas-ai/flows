Your principles are as follows## Principles- **Prioritize Effectiveness**: Do the right things.- **Be Kind Not Nice**: Be honest even if it means challenging niceties.- **Nurture a Growth Mindset**: Default to action, and embrace antifragility by learning continuously from successes and failures.- **Prioritize Planning Over Plans**: Planning is evergreen; plans are not. Get the clarity you need now and change course when necessary.   ---### **Prioritize Effectiveness**- **Effectiveness Over Efficiency**: Efficiency focuses on doing things right; effectiveness emphasizes doing the right things. Do the most important things first.- **Act on Key Priorities**: Always start with the most impactful challenges or tasks to ensure that your efforts produce the most substantial outcomes.### **Be Kind Not Nice**- **Be a Constructive [Jerk](https://share.snipd.com/episode/a81df2f0-f4a1-43ec-acf2-e8c607e35e3c)**: Champion honesty and truth, even if it challenges conventional niceties or creates temporary discomfort.- **Empathetic Honesty**: While truth is paramount, deliver feedback with empathy and genuine care for the individual.### **Nurture a Growth Mindset**- **Default to Action**: Cultivate a proactive mindset.

He is known for his series of non-fiction books with titles like \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards\" and \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses\" which suggest he has made quite a career out of these explorations, despite being somewhat cynical of the supernatural.\n\nIn terms of his life story, there isn't an extensive background provided for Enslin within the short story, but from the details presented, we can extrapolate certain aspects. Enslin is likely a skeptic at heart, fueled by his interest in debunking myths of the paranormal rather than confirming them. This skepticism serves as both a strength and a driving force behind his career. His works imply a systematic and rigorous approach to his explorations, which would require discipline and an analytical mind—traits that contribute to his success as an author.\n\nEnslin's strengths are also evident in his willingness to confront fear and the unknown. By consistently placing himself in places deemed terrifying by others, Enslin demonstrates courage and a strong will. He's resourceful, adapting to various situations he encounters within these haunted locations, and he has a knack for descriptive writing that captivates his readers.\n\nWhen it comes to his priorities in life, it seems that Enslin values truth and reality over superstition, wanting to either validate or debunk the existence of the paranormal with actual experiences. This dedication to his craft suggests a commitment to both his readers and himself to pursue the truth, no matter how frightening or dangerous his investigations may become.\n\nDrawing from all this, the essence of Mike Enslin's character speaks to the human experience of facing the unknown and the lengths one might go to find answers to life's most profound mysteries. His strength lies in his quest for truth, but it's also his vulnerability, as his experiences in Room 1408 reveal the fragile grip we all have on what we perceive as reality.","x":250,"y":350,"width":200,"height":200,"color":"4"},{"id":"2c49db87-7675-49de-831f-f3574a6acfd8","type":"text","text":"1.
