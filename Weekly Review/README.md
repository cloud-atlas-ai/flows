# Weekly Review

The weekly review flow is a weekly review of a week's daily notes, events and tasks. It summarizes your progress towards your priorities. It's meant to be executed from a weekly note.

## Suggested usage

For this flow to work well:

- You should have a daily note for each day of the week.
- You should have a single note for the week.
- In the weekly note, you should list your priorities and strengths.
- In the weekly note, you should have wikilinks to each day in that week.
- At the end of the week, after adding your daily notes, run this flow to help you recognize your progress, and plan for the next week.
