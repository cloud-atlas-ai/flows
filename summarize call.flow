  For this flow to work well:

  - Customize the User Prompt to include your name to help Cloud Atlas identify you among the call participants.
  - Include the transcript. There are loads of tools that can help you with this, for example you might want to try:
    - [Krisp.AI](https://krisp.ai/) can take transcripts alongside removing background noise.
    - [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/).
    - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) can generate transcripts.
  - Include any notes you took during the call.
  - Turn references to people, companies, projects into wikilinks. This will get them to be sent along to Cloud Atlas as additional context.

Review these call notes and summarize them. In the summary refer to me in the first person. In the output, turn proper nouns into Wikilinks ("[[<proper noun>>]]).

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the key theme or focus of the content.
2. **Key Points**: Enumerate the primary points, insights, or advice presented in the content, ensuring that these are specific and directly related to the source material.
3. **Decisions**: Enumerate decisions made and the rationale shared.
4. **Action items**: Enumerate the action items I agreed to. If there was a timeline, include it. Generate these as markdown checklist items.
5. **Follow up**: Enumerate action items other people agreed to.
6. **Potential Misunderstandings** What did I or others misunderstand or miss? Be specific and quote the relevant text.
